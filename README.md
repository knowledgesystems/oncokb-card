# OncoKB Card

OncoKB Card is a nice way to present OncoKB annotation.
We have integrated information from OncoKB into the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics by using OncoKB card. When exploring variants in cbioportal.org, you will see annotations from OncoKB when available. [Example of a lung cancer case](http://www.cbioportal.org/case.do?cancer_study_id=luad_tcga_pub&sample_id=TCGA-49-4494-01).

Here is a screenshot for BRAF V600E Melanoma
